# JavaScript_and_jQuery

This is an archive of the code snippets typed up from the book "JavaScript & jQuery" by Jon Duckett.

Unfortunately I only really read through chapter 1 before deciding to dedicate my time elsewhere. I intend to return to it one day. I have advanced my knowledge of the web stack significantly since I began reading this, however.

[I did complete his other book, "HTML & CSS", which was excellent.](../../../HTML_and_CSS)
