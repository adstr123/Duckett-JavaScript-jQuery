# JavaScript_and_jQuery

This is an archive of the code snippets typed up from the book "JavaScript & jQuery" by Jon Duckett.

In 2016 I only really read through chapter 1 before deciding to dedicate my time elsewhere - I dove into freelancing.

[I did complete his other book, "HTML & CSS", which was excellent.](../../../HTML_and_CSS)

EDIT 03/2020: I have advanced my knowledge of the web stack significantly since I began reading this, but at the beginning of 2020 I have decided to return to it for a few reasons:

1. To review absolute fundamentals - it's easy to get lazy with some of these! I should be able to explain these, with ease, to a total JavaScript beginner.
2. As a nice comparison exercise to highlight just how much web technologies (particularly JavaScript) have changed in nearly half a decade.
3. To really understand what role jQuery had and why it became so popular - up til now I have been tolerating it and understanding it to a depth where I can work with legacy code, but no deeper.
